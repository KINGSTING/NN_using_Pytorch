# 📝 Short Description of Activity 2
This activity guided you through the entire machine learning pipeline to build and train a deep neural network for binary classification using PyTorch.

The core goal was to create a Student Pass/Fail Classifier based on synthetic data features (Study Hours and Attendance Rate).

Key Learning Outcomes:

    PyTorch Fundamentals: You learned to create and manipulate Tensors and understand Automatic Differentiation (autograd)—the backbone of training neural networks.

    Model Architecture: You implemented a multi-layer perceptron (nn.Module subclass) with two hidden layers (ReLU activation) and an output layer (Sigmoid) for binary prediction.

    Training Pipeline: You defined the Binary Cross-Entropy Loss and the Adam Optimizer and executed a full training loop over 500 epochs using mini-batches (DataLoader).

    Evaluation and Reflection: You assessed the model's performance using metrics like Accuracy, Precision, and Recall, and visualized the learning process through loss curves and the final Decision Boundary.

In essence, you successfully took a raw dataset and transformed it into an accurate, fully functional deep learning model using industry-standard tools and practices.
